【DIALOGUE】:

1. [0s-4s] (Camera Movement: Steadicam Walk+Shot Type: Long Shot, Medium Shot)
Plot: In a long shot, a quiet residential street at dusk. Takumi Nishioka walks alone, school bag slung over one shoulder, heading home after a long day. Streetlights begin to flicker on. The camera follows behind him in a steady walking motion, then gently pushes into a medium shot from the front as he exhales, lost in thought. In the final second, a figure approaches from the opposite direction, still out of focus.

2. [4s-8s] (Camera Movement: Rack Focus+Shot Type: Long Shot, Medium Shot)
Plot: In the long shot, Takumi and the approaching figure pass each other by half a step. The camera rack-focuses from Takumi to the girl behind him—Okita Anri—who suddenly stops. Takumi also pauses. Both turn around almost simultaneously. The camera cuts to alternating medium shots of their surprised faces. Takumi blurts out, confused: "Oh—are you… Okita?" At the same time, Anri speaks in disbelief: "Wait… are you Takumi?" The final second returns to a long shot, capturing their mirrored reactions.

3. [8s-12s] (Camera Movement: Push-in Shot+Shot Type: Medium Shot, Close-up Shot)
Plot: In a medium shot, the distance between them feels charged and awkward. The camera slowly pushes in as recognition settles in their eyes. Anri lets out a small, nervous laugh; Takumi scratches the back of his head, equally flustered. The camera cuts to a close-up of their faces, now clearly relieved and surprised to see each other here. The street noise fades slightly, emphasizing the moment.

4. [12s-16s] (Camera Movement: Handheld Camera Effect+Shot Type: Medium Shot, Close-up Shot)
Plot: In a medium shot, Anri suddenly steps forward and instinctively grabs Takumi's hand. Takumi stiffens for a split second, then tightens his grip in return. The camera switches to a gentle handheld close-up of their joined hands, conveying warmth and spontaneity. Both laugh softly, still stunned by the coincidence. The final second pulls back to a medium shot of them standing together under the streetlight, hands clasped, the moment lingering as the scene ends.
